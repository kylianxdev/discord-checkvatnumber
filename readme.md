Here is an example of a python discord bot that checks a VAT number using the vatlayer API and sends the company name in the chat if it was correct:

This bot will listen for messages that start with !checkvat and check the VAT number that follows. It will then use the vatlayer API to validate the VAT number and get the company name. If the VAT number is valid, it will send the company name in the chat. Otherwise, it will send an error message.

Note: To use this bot, you will need to sign up for an account on vatlayer and get an API key. You will also need to create a Discord bot and get its token. You can find more information on how to do this in the Discord and vatlayer API documentation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
